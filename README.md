### What I learned

Using variables to define properties, though not 100% accpted by all browsers at the moment but, I believe it's the future, so we prepare for it. :)

See code snippet below:

```css
:root
    {
      --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      --Light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      --Grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
      --Dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
      --font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
      --Shadow: hsl(229deg 6% 66% / 44%);
     
    }
```
### Continued development

Surely going to take on more challenges on Fronend Mentor, it's really a recommended Frontend mentoring platform.
